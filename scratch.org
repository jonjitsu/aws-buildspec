buikdspec [option] [subcommand] [phases]

Options:
-f FILE           buildspec.yml file to use
-s SHELL          shell to use (default: /bin/sh)
-i, --image IMAGE run buildspec inside container
                  default: run on system
                  checks for the container locally first
-v, --volume      volume mappings

Phases: one of the predefined phases in the buildspec

Subcommand:
init              generate a buildspec.yml
                  renames any conflicting one
validate          validate the buildspec.yml

 
** --image
project_dir: the directory and subdirectories starting from CWD

mount project_dir as /tmp/somerandomthing/src
make word_dir /tmp/somerandomthing/src
execute lines within the phases one at a time as:
docker ...otheroptions... run --rm /bin/bash -c 'LINE'

** codebuild run
CodeBuild will create a temporary compute container of the class defined in the build project
load it with the specified runtime environment
download the source code
execute the commands configured in the project
upload the generated artifact to an S3 bucket
and then destroy the compute container

During the build, CodeBuild will stream the build output to the service console and Amazon CloudWatch Logs.
